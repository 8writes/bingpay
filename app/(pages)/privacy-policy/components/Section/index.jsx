          <h1>How we protect your personal information?</h1>
          <p>
            1.1 We are serious about guarding the security of your personal
            information and use a secure server to store your personal

            information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we
            will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee
            the security of your data during transmission, and any transmission
            is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will
            use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent
            unauthorized access. 1.3 We restrict access of your personal
            information to those employees of Bingpay who have a business reason
            for knowing such information. We continuously educate and train our
            employees about the importance of confidentiality and privacy of
            customer information. We maintain physical, electronic and
            procedural safeguards that comply with the relevant laws and
            regulations to protect your personal information from unauthorized
            access.

          <p>
            3.1 Our Services use cookies to distinguish you from other users.

          </p>
          <h1>Discolure of information</h1>
          <p>
            We may share your information with selected third parties including:
            (a) affiliates, business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for

            assist us in conducting or co-operating in investigations of fraud

            published list of all of the third parties with whom we share your
            data with, as this would be heavily dependent on your specific use
            of our Services. However, if you would like further information
            about who we have shared your data with, or to be provided with a
            list specific to you, you can request this by writing to

          </p>
          <h1>Where we store your personal data?</h1>
          <p>
            6.1 The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and
            stored at, secured serves. It may also be processed by staff who
            work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged
            in, among other things, the fulfilment of your payment order, the
            processing of your payment details and the provision of support
            services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this
            transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably
            necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in

          <h1>7. Profiling and Automated Decision Making</h1>
          <p>
            7.1 We may use some instances of your data in order to customize our
            Services and the information we provide to you, and to address your
            needs - such as your country of address and transaction history. For
            example, if you frequently send funds from one particular currency
            to another, we may use this information to inform you of new product
            updates or features that may be useful for you. When we do this, we
            take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security
            are protected - and we only use pseudonym data where ever possible.
            This activity has no legal effect on you. 7.2 As part of being a
            highly technical and innovative company, we may use Automated
            Decision Making (ADM) in order to improve your experience, or to
            help fight financial crime. For example, so that we can provide you
            with a fast and efficient service, we may use ADM to verify your
            identity documents, or to confirm the accuracy of the information
            you have provided to us. None of our ADM processes have a legal
            effect on you.
